  abstract  = {[(1) The effects of temperature on capture probability, attack coefficient (or instantaneous search rate), handling time, swimming speed and capture rate of two fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), were studied in the laboratory. (2) The attack coefficient increased exponentially for both species. Handling time decreased asymptotically with temperature for perch and in a sigmoid way for roach. Roach had a longer handling time and lower capture rate than perch at low temperatures (12-18 degrees C), while the reverse was the case at high temperatures (18-21 degrees C). The results suggest a shift in the species having the highest competitive ability at a temperature around 18 degrees C. The increased capture rate and decreased handling time of roach at high temperatures was attributable to an increase in swimming speed and capture success. (3) The temperature region (17-19 degrees C) within which capture rate and handling time intersected for perch and roach in the laboratory study was compared with the vertical distribution of the species in thermally stratified lakes. A high correspondence between the predictions from the laboratory data and the actual field distribution of the species was found. (4) It is argued that including temperature in foraging models will improve both the predictions of prey selection and of resource partitioning in poikilothermic animals. Temperature may also mediate coexistence between poikilotherms in environments in which temperature varies spatially and temporally.]},

  abstract  = {Predator-prey dynamics between the sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa and juvenile winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were examined in laboratory experiments to assess the joint effects of varying prey density and temperature on shrimp foraging behavior and flounder mortality. The functional response of shrimp to 6 densities of flounder was determined at 2 temperatures (10 and 16°C). The behavioral mechanisms underlying the shrimp's functional response were quantified with visual observations and compared to the foraging parameters predicted by continuous-time functional response models. Shrimp consumption rates increased significantly with increasing flounder density, irrespective of water temperature. At low flounder densities, however, significantly more flounder were consumed at 16°C than at 10°C. Analysis of proportional mortality of flounder across prey density and general functional response models revealed a sigmoidal, Type III functional response at 10°C, and a hyperbolic, Type II functional response at 16°C. Model parameter estimates and visual observations of shrimp foraging behavior suggest that the variable functional responses at different temperatures are the result of cold temperatures decreasing predator activity at low flounder densities, and conversely, shrimp maintaining high attack rates at low flounder densities when exposed to warm temperatures. These findings indicate that shrimp are capable of driving flounder populations to local extinction during warm water conditions. The recent warming trend experienced in northwest Atlantic estuaries, and its impact on trophic dynamics, may therefore explain the failure of the winter flounder stocks to recover in these areas.},

Here, we provide a general scaling model of maximum speed with body mass, which holds across locomotion modes, ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. In contrast to traditional power-law scaling, we predict a hump-shaped relationship resulting from a finite acceleration time for animals, which explains why the largest animals are not the fastest. This model is strongly supported by extensive empirical data (474 species, with body masses ranging from 30 $\mu$g to 100 tonnes) from terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. Our approach unravels a fundamental constraint on the upper limit of animal movement, thus enabling a better understanding of realized movement patterns in nature and their multifold ecological consequences.},

  abstract  = {Empirical feeding studies where density-dependent consumption rates are fitted to functional response models are often used to parameterize the interaction strengths in models of population or food-web dynamics. However, the relationship between functional response parameter estimates from short-term feeding studies and real-world, long-term, trophic interaction strengths remains largely unexamined. In a critical first step to address this void, we tested for systematic effects of experimental duration and predator satiation on the estimate of functional response parameters, namely attack rate and handling time. Analyzing a large data set covering a wide range of predator taxa and body masses, we show that attack rates decrease with increasing experimental duration, and that handling times of starved predators are consistently shorter than those of satiated predators. Therefore, both the experimental duration and the predator satiation level have a strong and systematic impact on the predictions of population dynamics and food-web stability. Our study highlights potential pitfalls at the intersection of empirical and theoretical applications of functional responses. We conclude our study with some practical suggestions for how these implications should be addressed in the future to improve predictive abilities and realism in models of predator–prey interactions.},

abstract = {Predation rates for Chaoborus americanus on different types of noncyclomorphic zooplankton prey were determined in the laboratory as a function of both prey species and density. The sequence of events leading to consumption of prey was also observed, and probabilities determined for the various components. Predation rates generally reached an upper limit as the density of prey increased to high levels. Larger prey were always less vulnerable to Chaoborus predation. Among the species of zooplankton prey examined Holopedium gibberum suffered the lowest rates of predation, while those of the other plankters (Daphnia pulex, D. rosea, Moina hutchinsoni, Diaptomus birgei, D. leptopus, Cyclops vernalis) were approximately equivalent for any given size category. Observation of the predatory sequence indicates that for all the plankters except H. gibberum there were relatively high rates of evasion of attack by C. americanus and low rates of escape after capture. For H. gibberum the situation was reversed, and escape after capture was particularly important in determining the predation rate. The gelatinous envelope of Holopedium gibberum seems to operate as an effective anti-predator device which reduces the likelyhood of retention by Chaoborus after contact has been made.},

Feeding trials were completed in glass microcosms which contained one of three - nine densities of small or large individuals of each prey species. 2. Mortality by Dugesia on small and large Aedes followed a type II functional response, whereas the mortality of Daphnia resembled a type III functional response. Prey mortality imposed by Dugesia consisted of consumptive and non-consumptive elements. Non-consumptive mortality occurred when prey individuals trapped in mucus trails subsequently died but were not ingested. 3. Additional experiments were conducted to quantify consumptive (capture followed by ingestion) and non-consumptive mortality (death not followed by ingestion). 4. Consumptive mortality followed a type II functional response for small and large individuals of both prey spedes, whereas non-consumptive mortality increased with prey density, although the relationships differed with prey species and size. The non-consumptive mortality of large Daphnia increased at an accelerating rate with prey density and exceeded consumptive mortality at intermediate prey abundances. In contrast, non-consumptive mortality of small Aedes and small Daphnia was lower than consumptive mortality and either increased with prey density at a decelerating (small Aedes) or accelerating (small Daphnia) rate. 5.

The major objective was to determine relative predatory abilities of the larvae by fitting feeding rate data to developmental and functional response models. Feeding success, prey capture success, attack rates, handling times and search rates were estimated. Prey consumption rates and attack rates of bay anchovy usually were highest, but at the lowest prey level (50 per liter) first-feeding sea bream larvae had the highest consumption rate. Sea bream could consume prey at near-maximum rates at prey levels lower than those required by the other species. As larvae grew, time searching per attack decreased rapidly for all species, especially at low prey levels. Handling time also decreased, but most rapidly for bay anchovy. Search rates were highest for bay anchovy and lowest for lined sole. Bay anchovy had the best apparent predation ability, but when previous results on larval growth rates, survival rates and growth efficiencies were considered, sea bream larvae were the most efficient predators and the least likely of the three species to be limited by low prey levels.},

abstract = {(1) Growth rate and size at moult increased with prey density for Notonecta hoffmanni Hungerford nymphs raised at various densities of their mosquito larvae prey. (2) The functional response of different sized instar IV nymphs was type-2, and large predators ate more at high prey densities than did small predators. (3) The feeding rate of individual predators did not vary in any regular way during the instar. Predator size at the start of the instar was a good predictor of the predators' functional responses for both long- and short-term experiments. Short-term experiments were good predictors of the long-term functional responses: the relationship between these two responses remains linear over a wide range of prey densities. These facts allow us to predict the functional response over the whole instar from a knowledge of predator weight. (4) Variation in predator size within one instar (IV) was as important as differences in the predators' size in different instars in determining the predator's feeding rate. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Functional response models based on Holling's disc equation allow the use of one-predator/one-prey experiments to predict the feeding rates of a predator when >1 prey type is available. Single-prey trials at 6 densities of each prey were used to measure the functional responses of 10th-instar naiads of the damselfly Enallagma aspersum to a copepod, Diaptomus spatulocrenatus, and a cladoceran, Simocephalus serrulatus. Roger's random predator equation, a modification of Holling's type 2 functional response equation, described the data well. The predictions of a one-predator/two-prey model based on the random predator equation were tested by performing all 36 pairwise combinations of densities of the 2 prey species in a factorial design. The model fails to predict results adequately. Preference varied slightly with the density of Diaptomus both increased significantly with increasing density of Simocephalus, and the 'handling time' parameter for predation on Simocephalus decreased significantly with increasing density of Diaptomus. There was no evidence of switching behavior in this system. A modified random predator model, which incorporates changes in the 'attack rate' and 'handling time' parameters with alternate prey density, provided a better fit to the two-prey data. -from Author},

The authors describe Piona functional responses generated under a range of conditions and compare them using "parallel curve analysis' and a maximum likelihood method of estimating curve parameters. Rates of predation on a range of cladoceran prey show "thresholds' of prey size at which rates change abruptly. These thresholds are specific to each size of predator. Females, males and nymphs of Piona exhibit their highest predation rates on Daphnia carinata, Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus, respectively. These rates are relatively insensitive to temperatures  > 15°C. Predation rates of adult Piona on Daphnia  < 1.5mm in length were similar to those of fourth instar Chaoborus at the same temperature and prey density. -from Authors},

abstract = {Young-of-the-year (YOY) bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (L.) impose significant mortality on recently metamorphosed striped bass, Morone saxatilis (W.) in the Hudson River estuary. Field observations indicate that bluefish selectivity on striped bass increases with increasing striped bass density suggesting a density-dependent feeding response. Functional response and switching experiments were conducted to aid in determining the mechanism for this response. The type of functional response exhibited by bluefish under several prey treatments was examined. These were striped bass alone, Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia (L.) alone, striped bass with a background density of alternative prey, and striped bass in the presence of eelgrass Zostera marina (L.). The functional response of bluefish to increasing prey density was more similar to a type 1 or II model than a type III model under all treatments. Switching was examined by providing bluefish both striped bass and silversides at five different ratios with and without a prey refuge, eelgrass. Bluefish did not exhibit a type III functional response or switching behavior suggesting that these mechanisms do not explain the observed density-dependent selectivity pattern in the field. Switching experiments did suggest that the presence of prey refuge can determine selectivity by YOY bluefish in the field. The abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation and other prey refuge may be important in controlling the predatory impact of bluefish on striped bass in the Hudson River.

@article{Bergstrom2004,
abstract = {1. In a laboratory experiment, we studied the effect of arena size on the functional response of the mysid shrimp Neomysis integer preying on the cladoceran Polyphemus pediculus. The aim of the study was to examine mechanisms that cause the functional response to be scale-dependent, by documenting the spatial distribution and the movement behaviour of predator and prey. 2. The attack rate was significantly higher in large arenas, while the handling time did not differ between arena sizes. The difference in attack rate could be explained by differences in aggregative behaviour of predator and prey and in swimming activity of the predator. It is suggested that distributions of animals are often affected by the walls of the experimental arenas and that this spatial heterogeneity is scale-dependent, which may have a considerable impact on estimates of ecological process rates. 3. A method of correcting attack rate estimates for artefacts caused by such spatial heterogeneity is presented.},

@article{Barnhisel2004,
abstract = {Functional response experiments with alternative prey demonstrate how an exotic zooplankter co-exists with salmonid fish in Lake Superior. Young lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) response to Daphnia, a typical prey genus, and to Bythotrephes, a spined invertebrate predator that invaded North America in the mid-1980s, is examined in a variety of laboratory experiments that span various prey densities, frequencies, experience, and consumer size. Bythotrephes' caudal spine protects the animal from small fish predation. At intermediate densities, the spiny cladoceran also disrupts foraging behavior of young-of-year fish. Lake trout response to Bythotrephes is dependent on the length of the spine and fish size. The degree to which lake trout are able to discriminate between prey and resume their prior attack rate on Daphnia depends on the absolute density of Daphnia and the frequency with which fish encounter Bythotrephes. For both experienced and na{\"{i}}ve fish, aversive behavior to Bythotrephes occurs after a certain threshold of encounters. Under conditions of high encounter rates, once aversive behavior is established in YOY fish, foraging efficiency on Daphnia improves because Bythotrephes is recognized and ignored. The density-dependent behavioral and functional responses resemble classical predator reactions to unpalatable prey.},

@article{Bailey1989,
abstract = {Functional response curves were constructed for adult Ranatra dispar feeding on four different densities of notonectid prey at 15, 20, 25 and 30°C. Values for the attack‐rate and handling time were estimated from Roger's random predator equation. The most generally applicable response was the type II, with the mean number of prey eaten increasing with increase in temperature. The attack‐rate was linearly related to temperature while handling time decreased exponentially with increase in temperature, although values changed very little between 20 and 30°C. It is suggested that changes in metabolic activity and related ‘hunger' effects on various components of predatory behaviour account for the observed number of prey eaten up to 25°C, however, an increase in the level of prey activity at 30°C may influence the observed number of prey caught (and eaten) at this higher temperature.

abstract = {(1) The functional response of the fish predator Brachydanio rerio Hamilton- Buchanan to changes in the density of two prey species, Daphnia magna L. and the cercarial stage of the ectoparasitic digenean Transversotrema patialense (Soparkar), is shown to be of the type II form where the instantaneous predation rate is unaffected by changes in prey density. (2) A model is developed to describe this functional response, based on the concept of predator satiation. The number of prey items required to create satiation is shown to be dependent on the experimental procedures used to elicit the functional response. (3) The fish predator, Brachydanio rerio, acts in the dual role of predator/host for the cercarial stage of Transversotrema patialense. The concomitant predation and infection processes created by this ecological association are shown to be characterised by constant instantaneous predation and infection rates which appear to be unaffected by changes in prey/parasite density. (4) The infection process is unaffected by density dependent constraints over a wide range of exposure densities and the number of parasites attached per host is shown to be directly proportional to cercarial numbers. (5) Stochastic elements are shown to be important determinants in the dynamics of the infection process and overdispersion in the frequency distribution of the number of parasites attached per host is thought to be generated by heterogeneity between fish and heterogeneity in time created by changes in infective stage density. (6) The relevance of concomitant predation and infection processes to the dynamics of digenean life cycles is discussed.},
