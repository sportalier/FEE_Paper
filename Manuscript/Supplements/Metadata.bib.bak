  abstract  = {[(1) The effects of temperature on capture probability, attack coefficient (or instantaneous search rate), handling time, swimming speed and capture rate of two fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), were studied in the laboratory. (2) The attack coefficient increased exponentially for both species. Handling time decreased asymptotically with temperature for perch and in a sigmoid way for roach. Roach had a longer handling time and lower capture rate than perch at low temperatures (12-18 degrees C), while the reverse was the case at high temperatures (18-21 degrees C). The results suggest a shift in the species having the highest competitive ability at a temperature around 18 degrees C. The increased capture rate and decreased handling time of roach at high temperatures was attributable to an increase in swimming speed and capture success. (3) The temperature region (17-19 degrees C) within which capture rate and handling time intersected for perch and roach in the laboratory study was compared with the vertical distribution of the species in thermally stratified lakes. A high correspondence between the predictions from the laboratory data and the actual field distribution of the species was found. (4) It is argued that including temperature in foraging models will improve both the predictions of prey selection and of resource partitioning in poikilothermic animals. Temperature may also mediate coexistence between poikilotherms in environments in which temperature varies spatially and temporally.]},

  abstract  = {Predator-prey dynamics between the sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa and juvenile winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were examined in laboratory experiments to assess the joint effects of varying prey density and temperature on shrimp foraging behavior and flounder mortality. The functional response of shrimp to 6 densities of flounder was determined at 2 temperatures (10 and 16°C). The behavioral mechanisms underlying the shrimp's functional response were quantified with visual observations and compared to the foraging parameters predicted by continuous-time functional response models. Shrimp consumption rates increased significantly with increasing flounder density, irrespective of water temperature. At low flounder densities, however, significantly more flounder were consumed at 16°C than at 10°C. Analysis of proportional mortality of flounder across prey density and general functional response models revealed a sigmoidal, Type III functional response at 10°C, and a hyperbolic, Type II functional response at 16°C. Model parameter estimates and visual observations of shrimp foraging behavior suggest that the variable functional responses at different temperatures are the result of cold temperatures decreasing predator activity at low flounder densities, and conversely, shrimp maintaining high attack rates at low flounder densities when exposed to warm temperatures. These findings indicate that shrimp are capable of driving flounder populations to local extinction during warm water conditions. The recent warming trend experienced in northwest Atlantic estuaries, and its impact on trophic dynamics, may therefore explain the failure of the winter flounder stocks to recover in these areas.},

Video records were used to quantify prey behaviour. Prey responsiveness, reactive distance, response latency, and apparent looming threshold were not affected by temperature. Response speeds increased with temperature. Predator error rate and capture success showed no consistent thermal effects. Although the experiments could not fully evaluate the influence of temperature on the predators, results suggest that the predator's performance largely governs the outcome of an attack on a larva and that higher temperatures favour the predator by increasing the frequency of its encounter with prey.

Trials were conducted at near natural temperature extremes for the larvae (8 and 13°C) to assess the importance of water temperature to the interaction. Herring larvae were significantly more responsive to attacks by herring than were plaice larvae (5{\textperiodcentered}7 vs 0′0%). The two prey species were equally responsive to attacks by cod (2–6 vs 10%). Cod caught 91% of herring larvae attacked and juvenile herring caught 87%. Cod were successful in 96% of attacks on plaice, but juvenile herring caught significantly fewer (83%) plaice larvae. For each predator species, capture success did not vary significantly with prey species. Overall capture success for herring was significantly lower than that for cod. Responsiveness of herring larvae to attacks by juvenile herring increased with temperature, but predator error rate and capture success were not altered by water temperature.

In addition, the reaction distance (RD) of both species was measured. Handling time decreased and capture rate increased with increasing temperature for both perch and ruffe. The response of handling time and capture rate to temperature was more pronounced for perch than for ruffe. Routine swimming performance increased with increasing temperature for perch but not significantly so for ruffe. The laboratory study showed that the foraging ability of ruffe was less sensitive to temperature than it was for perch. These results were consistent with the vertical distributions of both species in thermally stratified lakes; ruffe, which occurred at all depths, utilized a wider temperature range than perch.},

  abstract     = {Speed is the fundamental constraint on animal movement, yet there is no general consensus on the determinants of maximum speed itself. Here, we provide a general scaling model of maximum speed with body mass, which holds across locomotion modes, ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. In contrast to traditional power-law scaling, we predict a hump-shaped relationship resulting from a finite acceleration time for animals, which explains why the largest animals are not the fastest. This model is strongly supported by extensive empirical data (474 species, with body masses ranging from 30 $\mu$g to 100 tonnes) from terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. Our approach unravels a fundamental constraint on the upper limit of animal movement, thus enabling a better understanding of realized movement patterns in nature and their multifold ecological consequences.},

  abstract  = {Empirical feeding studies where density-dependent consumption rates are fitted to functional response models are often used to parameterize the interaction strengths in models of population or food-web dynamics. However, the relationship between functional response parameter estimates from short-term feeding studies and real-world, long-term, trophic interaction strengths remains largely unexamined. In a critical first step to address this void, we tested for systematic effects of experimental duration and predator satiation on the estimate of functional response parameters, namely attack rate and handling time. Analyzing a large data set covering a wide range of predator taxa and body masses, we show that attack rates decrease with increasing experimental duration, and that handling times of starved predators are consistently shorter than those of satiated predators. Therefore, both the experimental duration and the predator satiation level have a strong and systematic impact on the predictions of population dynamics and food-web stability. Our study highlights potential pitfalls at the intersection of empirical and theoretical applications of functional responses. We conclude our study with some practical suggestions for how these implications should be addressed in the future to improve predictive abilities and realism in models of predator–prey interactions.},
